abstract = "Crowdfunding is an emerging online fundrais- ing mechanism for creators to launch campaigns (projects) to solicit funds or expand their influence among backers. Tracking the dynamics, i.e., daily funding amount can be of great help to campaign creators as well as contributors. Previous works on this subject fit the fluctuations of time-series with predefined stochastic precess or apply a regularization term to constrain learned tendencies, resulting in limited generalization abilities. Patterns of funding-amount sequences in crowdfunding are often exclusive and non-linear, making previous predictors suboptimal. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method based on synthesized basis which can be composed into all sorts of patterns. Concretely, we build a large candidate basis set and select from them based on reliability, diversity and latent structures. We use representations of sequences in this basis space as a predictor, and adopt a dual-graph to exploit neighboring information to enhance its prediction power. Experiments demonstrates the advantage of our method over state-of-arts."
