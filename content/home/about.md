# Biography

I am currently a Ph.D student majoring in computer science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Professor [Linli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~linlixu/) and [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). I received my bachelor's degree in USTC at 2016. I was a research intern in Machine Learning Group at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) from May to September in 2018, mentored by Doctor [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/).

My main research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, specifically in sequence modeling and representation learning, as well as their applications in natural language processing and heterogeneous types of data such as networks.

You can contact me through a@b, where a=guojunll and b=mail.ustc.edu.cn.
